                    <h2>Welcome!</h2>
                    <p>Creature Combat is a turn-based game that challenges you to defeat all the other wizards in
                        the dungeon arena. Thank you for playing my game!</p>
                    <h2>How to play</h2>
                    <h3>Game Configuration</h3>
                    <h4>Wizards</h4>
                    <p>To begin the game, first select how many wizards are taking part in this tournament. To do this,
                        enter a number between 2 and 8.</p>
                    <p><img src="img/number_of_wizards.png" alt="Number of wizards"></p>
                    <p class="italic">(clicking the up and down arrows also changes the number of starting wizards)</p>
                    <p>Once you're happy with the number of participants, click <img src="img/play_button.png"
                            alt="Play Game" style="vertical-align:middle"></p>
                    <h4>Naming and colours</h4>
                    <p>It's important to know who is playing and who your opponents are! Each wizard can enter their
                        name here by selecting on the left and modifying the details on the right:</p>
                    <p><img src="img/game_setup.png" alt="Wizard configuration"></p>
                    <p>Select a colour from the list available; it's important to also look the part!</p>
                    <p>Here, humans can also choose to allow the computer to play by checking the AI option <img
                            src="img/ai.png" alt="AI selected" style="vertical-align: middle">; be
                        careful, expect no mercy!</p>
                    <p class="italic">(you may also configure the game to play using only AI wizards too!)</p>
                    <p>When all wizards are named and have an appropriate robe colour, go right ahead and click <img
                            src="img/play_game_button.png" alt="" Play Game" style="vertical-align:middle"> to continue.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Playing the Game</h2>
                    <p></p>
                    <h3>The Wizard's Turn</h3>
                    <p>Play begins immediately with the first wizard (human or AI!). Wizards have been placed in an
                        appropriate location depending on the number of opponents and have also been given a random
                        selection of spells that can be used to summon creatures that fight for you!</p>
                    <p>Wizards controlled by AI can skip this next bit…</p>
                    <p><img src="img/wizard_with_focus.png" alt="Wizard with focus"></p>
                    <p>Let's play!</p>
                    <h3>Interacting with the game</h3>
                    <p>At the beginning, only a player's wizard is available as they haven't summoned any creatures yet.
                        A wizard (and later summoned creatures) can take actions, like moving around, attacking and
                        more…</p>
                    <h4>Navigating the arena</h4>
                    <p>Before going further, let's take a moment to take a look around the arena.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>To rotate the camera, press the middle mouse button and move the mouse left and right (or
                            swiping on a trackpad). The keyboard 'Q' and 'E' keys (on a qwerty keyboard) rotate too.
                        </li>
                        <li>Right-click and hold while dragging the mouse around pans the view (shift+swipe on a
                            trackpad). Keyboard controls are WASD.</li>
                        <li>Pressing 'F' on the keyboard will move the camera back to the wizard under your control.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Notice the position of other wizards in the arena; these are your main opponents! Let's move on..
                    </p>
                    <h4>Moving</h4>
                    <p>To move around, click the wizard; this will show a green icon that means they're selected. Notice
                        the game also shows the actions they may perform:</p>
                    <p><img src="img/wizard_actions.png" alt="Wizard actions"></p>
                    <p>To navigate around the arena, select the <img src="img/move_button.png" alt="Move button"
                            style="vertical-align:middle"> action. The game shows how far the selected
                        wizard can move (wizards can only move a single cell!).</p>
                    <p><img src="img/movement_range.png" alt="Movement range"></p>
                    <p>To move to another location, click the desired cell; the wizard will move!</p>
                    <p><video width="640" controls>
                            <source src="video/wizard_move.mp4" type="video/mp4"> Your browser does not support the video
                            tag.
                        </video></p>
                    <h4>Casting a Spell</h4>
                    <p>This is how a wizard can defend themselves and go on the offence! Click the <img
                            src="img/cast_spell.png" alt="Cast spell button" style="vertical-align:middle"> action
                        button; the game highlights available cells as a possible spell target.</p>
                    <p class="italic">Think about the surrounding area - later in the game, a wizard may wish to
                        obstruct the path of an enemy by casting a spell in their way, or perhaps a particular direction
                        is closer to another wizard making it easier to attack.</p>
                    <p>Click on a target cell. A spell selection window appears!</p>
                    <p><img src="img/spell_selection.png" alt="Spell selection"></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Spells: these are the spells the wizard knows, assigned when the game began. A spell may
                            also show a quantity e.g. "Ent (2)" means this wizard has two Ent (a large tree-like
                            creature) spells!</li>
                        <li>Description: shows details about the selected spell, e.g. its movement range or attack
                            strength. Most important is Cast Chance that indicates how likely a spell is to succeed;
                            typically tougher (meaning undead or stronger) creatures are harder to cast.</li>
                        <li>Illusion: this is also important; creating an illusion ignores cast chance. That is, the
                            spell is guaranteed to work... but more on that later!</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>When a wizard is happy with their choice, click <img src="img/cast_spell_button.png"
                            alt="Cast spell button" style="vertical-align:middle">. A wizard can also change their mind
                        and may perform another action if they're able to do so, perhaps deciding on a spell later (or
                        not at all!).</p>
                    <p>Depending on the success of the spell (as your first spell, choose a high cast chance!), the
                        wizard now has a creature!</p>
                    <p><img src="img/creature.png" alt="A summoned creature"></p>
                    <p>When first summoned, a creature can't really do anything yet...</p>
                    <h4>Illusions</h4>
                    <p>As mentioned, an illusion ignores the casting chance meaning that a spell will 100% work. An
                        illusion is the same as any other creature, with one exception; they're vulnerable to the
                        disbelieve spell.</p>
                    <h4>Disbelieve</h4>
                    <p>Wizards have a special ability, and that's to disbelieve a creature. Some creatures have a low
                        cast chance that may seem impossible to cast successfully so a player may have summoned an
                        illusion! When cast, if the creature was an illusion, they're instantly removed from the game!
                    </p>
                    <p class="italic">Note that a wizard can either cast a spell or disbelieve but not both!</p>
                    <h4>End Turn</h4>
                    <p>That's all you can do for now so to allow play to continue with the next wizard, click <img
                            src="img/end_turn_button.png" alt="End turn button" style="vertical-align:middle">. You'll
                        be asked if that's okay so just click <img src="img/ok_button.png" alt="OK button"
                            style="vertical-align:middle"> for now and play on!</p>
                    <p class="italic">You can always cancel here too just in case you've forgotten to do something!</p>
                    <h3>Your Next Turn</h3>
                    <p>Play continues with other wizards, who may cast spells and move around the board. They may even
                        try to disbelieve the creature summoned on your first turn (if you cast a spell).</p>
                    <p>This turn should play out as your first turn, only you may have an additional creature to use
                        too! Your creatures are highlighted so take a moment to take a look around the board and when
                        you're ready, select a creature as you would the wizard by clicking on them.</p>
                    <p>The creature's actions are shown the same way a wizard's actions are. The creature (or even the
                        wizard!) may be able to attack.</p>
                    <h4>Attack</h4>
                    <p>Attack works like other actions, by first selecting the action itself if available. Reasons a
                        creature can't attack could be because it is their first turn, or they're too far away from an
                        enemy creature or wizard. They must be located next to an enemy to attack them.</p>
                    <p><img src="img/attack_range.png" alt="Attack range"></p>
                    <p>Assuming the creature can attack, click the highlighted space occupied by the enemy. The creature
                        will attack the enemy!</p>
                    <p><video width="640" controls>
                            <source src="video/attack.mp4" type="video/mp4"> Your browser does not support the video
                            tag.
                        </video></p>
                    <p class="italic">Note that attacking a wizard should be a priority. Defeating a wizard also removes
                        their creatures from the game!</p>
                    <h3>Winning</h3>
                    <p>The game is won by destroying every opponent wizard, it's that easy (or is it?).</p>
                    <h2>Hints and Tips</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>An illusion has a 100% cast chance.</li>
                        <li>Attacking ends a unit's turn so consider moving first!<ul>
                                <li>Except for wizards, wizards are cool.</li>
                                <li>A ranged attack doesn't prevent moving either so certain creatures are capable of
                                    moving, attacking and shooting!
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Undead creatures can only be attacked by other undead creatures!</li>
                        <li>The wizard's casting ability is common; e.g. disbelieve or cast a creature spell, but
                            not both.</li>
